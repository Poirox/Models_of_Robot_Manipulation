This book evolved from a set of course notes from teaching EE543,
a 10-week course on robot manipulators in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington. My aim in the course was to enable ECE and ME grad students (senior undergrads petitioned 
and were usually successful
in the course as well) to  master a minimal set of concepts needed to solve kinematics problems related to robot arm designs,
and to apply them in a system context.
In terms of content, experienced readers will see a strong influence of "Introduction to Robotics,
Mechanics and Control," by John Craig and "Advanced Robotics, Redundancy and Optimization," by
Yoshihiko Nakamura, from which I originally learned this material. 

The strategy is to focus on a minimal set of concepts, and repeated practice of related skills rather than racing through a comprehensive syllabus or covering advanced research topics.
 
To build the pdf, type
```
>pdflatex full_Jul18.tex
```

This will be slow the first time you run it (image conversion) but much faster subsequently. 

If you find typos, please use branch ``typos''.
