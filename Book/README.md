This book evolved from a set of course notes from teaching EE543,
a 10-week course on robot manipulators in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington. My aim in the course was to enable ECE and ME grad students (senior undergrads petitioned 
and were usually successful
in the course as well) to  master a minimal set of concepts needed to solve kinematics problems related to robot arm designs,
and to apply them in a system context.
In terms of content, experienced readers will see a strong influence of "Introduction to Robotics,
Mechanics and Control," by John Craig and "Advanced Robotics, Redundancy and Optimization," by
Yoshihiko Nakamura, from which I originally learned this material. 

The strategy is to focus on a minimal set of concepts, and repeated practice of related skills rather than racing through a comprehensive syllabus or covering advanced research topics.

Computing options include Scilab scripts (from older offerings) and Python tools.
The latest Python tools, which perform 
forward and inverse kinematics computations for serial arms, are available in the IKBT package 
[ on Github ](https://github.com/uw-biorobotics/IKBT)
and documented in [ arXiv:1711.05412](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05412). It is recommended to 
use the up-to date Github tools instead of the provided scripts. 

Problems are provided for active learning.  In teaching the course, I spend about 1/2 the contact
hours on lecture, and the remainder supporting students while they work on the in-class-problems (``ICPs").   Then traditional 
homework problems and exams, done by each student individually,solidify the knowledge gained. 

Please use branch ``typos'' to fix typos.
