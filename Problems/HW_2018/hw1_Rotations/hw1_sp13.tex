Computer software may be used for any problem.   If computer software is used, please state which package you have used and give a concise script in addition to the result.

\subsection{}          % 1.1
A point in 3-Space is located at
\[
^0P = \bmat 5 \\-7\\3 \emat
\]
in Frame 0 and
\[
{^1P} = \bmat 16\\0\\3\emat \qquad {^3P} = \bmat 1.7\\-6\\-4\emat
\]
Finally, we are given that
\[
{^0_1R} = \bmat .961 & -.276&0\\.234 & .815 &-.530\\.146 & .509 & .848\emat
\]

\subsubsection{}
Find the origin of Frame 1 expressed in Frame 0.  Draw a diagram of the frames (does not have to be to scale) and give the numerical value of $O_1$.

\subsubsection{}
If
\[
{^1_2R} =  I
\]
Find $^1O_2$.



\subsection{}
Give the rotation matrix corresponding to a rotation about $X$ by $\theta$ followed by a rotation about the new $Z$ axis by $\alpha$.




\subsection{}
Frames $A$ and $B$ start out superimposed.  Then
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $B$ is rotated by $\theta_1$ about $X_A$.
  \item $B$ is rotated by $\theta_2$ about $Y_A$.
  \item $B$ is rotated by $\theta_3$ about $X_B$.
\end{enumerate}
Find ${^A_BR}$ after these rotations.  Multiply out the answer in symbolic form.


\subsection{}
Using the result of Section 2.6 (see notes), show that if $K=\bmat 0 & 1 & 0 \emat ^T$ then
\[
Rot(K,\theta) = rot(\hat{y}, \theta)
\]


\subsection{}

The following rotations are performed

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A roll-pitch-yaw rotation in which

   Roll = $16^\circ$, Pitch = $5^\circ$, Yaw = $4^\circ$

  \item A rotation about the current $Y$ axis by $45^\circ$.
  \item A rotation about the original $X$ (Roll) axis by $20^\circ$.
\end{enumerate}

Find the rotation matrix which represents the final orientation.   Multiply out your answer in numerical form.
