\section{Problem Set 1}

\subsection{}
Two frames are superimposed as shown below

\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{00831.png}

Give the rotation matrix, $^A_BR$


\subsection{}
Two frames, $A, B$ start out superimposed.

1) Frame $B$ is rotated by $45^\circ$ around $Z_A$


2) Frame $B$ is rotated by $90^\circ$ around $X_B$


3) Frame $B$ is rotated by $30^\circ$ around $Y_B$

Find $^A_BR$

\subsection{}
Two frames, $A, B$ start out superimposed.

1) Frame $B$ is rotated by $23^\circ$ around $Y_B$


2) Frame $B$ is rotated by $67^\circ$ around $Z_A$


3) Frame $B$ is rotated by $16^\circ$ around $Y_B$

Find $^A_BR$


\subsection{}
A car has the same attached frame as Example 2.6 in the notes.  Its initial orientation is level, with $X_0$ pointing North.

1) It drives up a $30^\circ$ ramp.

2) It turns left by $45^\circ$ (still on the ramp)

3) It turns about $Z_0$ until it's compass reads straight West.


Find $^0_3R$

{\bf Warning - tough problem!}

\subsection{}
The car of Example 2.6

1) Drives forward 10 meters

2) turns left by $60^\circ$

3) drives in reverse for 5m

4) turns right $90^\circ$ and drives forward 6m

5) goes down a ramp at $30^\circ$ angle for 3m

Assume that when the car turns it does not displace at all (not true of real cars!).

Find the 4x4 homogeneous transform $^0_5T$ whcih representes the final position and orientation

\newpage
\subsection{}
An industrial robot must put individual chocolates in a box, $B$, which sits on table, $T$.   The box is located on a table with laser scanner, $S$.

The following relationships are known:

\[
{^O_GT}\quad{^O_WT}\quad{^T_WT}\quad{^T_ST}\quad{^S_BT}
\]

\subsubsection{}
Draw the transform graph.

\subsubsection{}
Find ${^O_BT}$
