%%%%** Section 1
\section{Problem Set 1}

%%%%** Section 1.1
\subsection{Rotation Matrix}
Two frames are superimposed as shown below

\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{hw1p1_w18.png}

Give the rotation matrix, $^A_BR$


%%%%** Section 1.2
\subsection{Composition of Rotations}
Two frames, $A, B$ start out superimposed.

1) Frame $B$ is rotated by $\alpha$ around $Y_A$


2) Frame $B$ is rotated by $\beta$ around $X_A$


3) Frame $B$ is rotated by $\gamma$ around $Y_B$

Find $^A_BR$


%%%%** Section 1.3
\subsection{Composition of Rotations}
Two frames, $A, B$ start out superimposed.

1) Frame $B$ is rotated by $45^\circ$ around $Y_B$


2) Frame $B$ is rotated by $119^\circ$ around $Z_A$


3) Frame $B$ is rotated by $16^\circ$ around $Z_B$

Find $^A_BR$
 



%%%%** Section 1.4
\subsection{Composition of Rotations}
Two frames, $A, B$ start out superimposed.

1) Frame $B$ is rotated by $27.5^\circ$ around $X_B$


2) Frame $B$ is rotated by $-37.5^\circ$ around $Z_A$


3) Frame $B$ is rotated by $126^\circ$ around $Z_B$

Find $^A_BR$. Multiply out your answer in numerical form.





%%%%** Section 1.5
\subsection{Angle-Axis Rotation}
Using the result of Section 2.4 and 2.6 (see notes), show that if $K=\bmat 1 & 0 & 0 \emat ^T$ then
\[
Rot(K,\theta) = Rot(\hat{x}, \theta)
\]


%%%%** Section 1.6
\subsection{Composition of Rotations and RPY}

The following rotations are performed

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A roll-pitch-yaw rotation in which

   Roll = $16^\circ$, Pitch = $5^\circ$, Yaw = $4^\circ$

  \item A rotation about the current $Y$ axis by $45^\circ$.
  \item A rotation about the original $X$ (Roll) axis by $20^\circ$.
\end{enumerate}

Find the rotation matrix which represents the final orientation.   Multiply out your answer in numerical form.
