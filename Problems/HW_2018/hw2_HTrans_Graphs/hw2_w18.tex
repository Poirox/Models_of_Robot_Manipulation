\section{Problem Set 2}


Computer software may be used for any problem.   If computer software is used, please state which package you have used and give a concise script in addition to the result.


\subsection{Homogeneous Transforms}
Frames $A$ and $B$ start out superimposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Frame $B$ is translated along $Y_A$ by $L_1$.
    \item Frame $B$ is rotated by $\theta$ around $Z_A$.
    \item Frame $B$ is translated by $L_2$ along $X_B$
    \item Frame $B$ is rotated by $\gamma$ about $Y_B$.
    \item Frame $B$ is translated by $^BV = [v_x,v_y,v_z]^T$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{}
Draw a diagram showing all intermediate frames and their approximate relationships.

\subsubsection{}
Find the resulting 4x4 Homogenous transform $^A_BT$.


\subsection{Homogeneous Transforms}

A car has a roof-attached frame like the car of Example 2.6 (course notes).   The car
\begin{enumerate}
    \item drives in reverse for 10m
    \item turns left by $20^\circ$
    \item drives forward by 20m
    \item turns right by $90^\circ$
    \item goes down a ramp at angle $10^\circ$ for 10m
\end{enumerate}

What is the 4x4 homogenenous transform which represents the position and orientation of the car's frame after these moves?    Assume that all turns can be accomplished without any translation (unlike a real car).



\subsection{Transform Graphs}
An industrial robot must put individual chocolates in a box, $B$, which sits on table, $T$.   The box is located on a table with laser scanner, $S$.

The following relationships are known:

\[
{^O_GT}\quad{^W_OT}\quad{^T_WT}\quad{^T_ST}\quad{^S_BT}
\]

\subsubsection{}
Draw the transform graph.

\subsubsection{}
Find ${^O_BT}$

\subsubsection{}
Find ${^G_ST}$

\vspace{0.25in}
A block is on a moving conveyor belt.  We know the following facts and transforms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ${^U_CT},{^U_ST},{^U_MT},{^U_RT}$
  \item Each block is picked up from the belt and placed on the shelf.  The $i^{th}$ block is stacked to the right (in the $X_S$ direction) starting from frame $S$ when $i=0$.
  \item The block dimensions are $2\times2\times4$ units. They are placed on shelf with two short dimensions facing front.
  \item The camera finds the location of the block, ${^C_BT}$ but after the picture is taken, the belt continues to move in the $X_M$ direction for 0.5 seconds at 0.25 m/sec.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.15in}
\subsubsection{}
Find the configuration ${^R_BT}$, of the block in the robot frame after the belt has halted.

\subsubsection{}

Find the configuration of block \#$i$, expressed in frame R.
