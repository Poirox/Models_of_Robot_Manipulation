% Problem Statement and Learning Objectives for Chapter 02
\paragraph{Problem Statement}
 The problem this chapter addresses is to represent the position and orientation of rigid bodies and frames of reference in useful ways. 

\paragraph{Learning Objectives}
Upon completing this Chapter, the reader should be able to 
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Work with vectors and vector products.
	\item  Derive several mathematical represenations of 3D rigid body rotation
	\item  Represent any displacement and rotation of a rigid body by a 4x4 matrix (the homogeneous transformation).
        \item  Solve for unknown spatial relationships in terms of known spatial relationships using homogeneous transformations and transform graphs. 
\end{itemize}
