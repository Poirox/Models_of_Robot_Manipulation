\paragraph{Learning Objectives}
Upon completing this Chapter, the reader should be able to
\begin{itemize}
  \item compute velocity with different frames of computation and representation and understand the difference between these two frames. 

  \item define the linear and angular velocity of a rigid body. 

  \item compute the velocity and angular velocity of a link, based on the DH parameters and the velocities of the previous link.

  \item propagate the velocity calculation down the serial link chain to compute linear and angular velocity of an end effector. 

  \item extract a Jacobian Matrix from the velocity propagation calculation. 

  \item  state the relationship between joint velocities and end effector velocities using the Jacobian Matrix. 

  \item state the relationship between joint torques and end effector forces using the Jacobian Matrix.
