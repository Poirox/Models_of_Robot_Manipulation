% Problem Statement and Learning Objectives for Chapter 07

\paragraph{Problem Statement}
  
If a manipulator is asked to move from one pose to another, it must do so smoothly and with speed and acceleration which is under the control of the programmer.  
This chapter describes techniques for generating smooth trajectories between two positions of the robot manipulator.  Mathematically this problem can be thought of as that of finding a function of time which meets specified boundary conditions and other constraints.  

\paragraph{Learning Objectives} After completing this chapter, the student will be able to
\begin{itemize}
  \item Design or program linear trajectories with parabolic start and stop periods.
  \item Design or program trajectories based on cubic polynomials.
  \item Design or program trajectories which are constrained to move through via points.
  \item Design trajectories for the joints of a robot arm which result in straight trajectories in Cartesian space.
\end{itemize}
