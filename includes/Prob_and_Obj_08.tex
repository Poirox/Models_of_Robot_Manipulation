\paragraph{Problem Statement}

Motion planning is the process of finding a collision free path between two configurations of a manipulator, considering the presence of obstacles in the workspace.

Interestingly, this type of motion planning is usually very easy and natural for humans.  One exception is the case of moving a large bulky object such as a piano through small hallways and doors into a desired room.   This ``piano mover's problem" is similar to the motion planning problem we have posed above.  However if the object (piano) were being manipulated by a (large) serial robot arm, we would also have to consider all potential collisions between the arm and the environment, in addition to the collisions between the piano and the environment.
